# Simple Search Engine 🔍

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a functional search engine designed to process documents and retrieve information using various data structure implementations. The core objective is to compare the performance and time complexity of **Linear Data Structures** (Linked Lists) versus **Non-Linear Data Structures** (BST, AVL Trees) in building an Inverted Index.

## 🔑 Key Features
* **Indexing:** Builds an Inverted Index to map vocabulary to documents.
* **Retrieval Modes:**
    * **Boolean Retrieval:** Supports logical operations (AND, OR) to filter results.
    * **Ranked Retrieval:** Orders documents based on relevance scores.
* **Data Structures:** Implemented multiple backing structures to test scalability:
    * Singly Linked Lists.
    * Binary Search Trees (BST).
    * AVL Trees (Self-Balancing Trees).
* **Performance Analysis:** Includes a theoretical and practical comparison of Big-O time complexities for search and insertion operations.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java.
* **Core Concepts:** Inverted Index, Recursion, Balancing Algorithms (AVL Rotations).
* **Analysis:** Big-O Notation, Time Complexity.
